# SharpFFTPACK
C# version of [FFTPACK](http://www.netlib.org/fftpack/).

FFTPACK is a package of Fortran subprograms for the fast Fourier transform of periodic and other symmetric sequences. It includes complex, real, sine, cosine, and quarter-wave transforms. This package is curently used in several environments, such as the Phyton [SciPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/fftpack.html) module.

SharpFFTPACK it is originally developed as part of the [SMath Studio](http://smath.info/) plugin [FFTPACK](http://en.smath.info/forum/yaf_postst7230_FFTPACK.aspx) (made by Davide Carpi).

SharpFFTPACK starts from the conversion of jfftpack, the Java translation of fftpack (made by Baoshe Zhang).

The original FFTPACK was public domain, so SharpFFTPACK is public domain too.
